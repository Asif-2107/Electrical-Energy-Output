# Electrical-Energy-Output
The Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set is a dataset containing hourly average ambient variables and net hourly electrical energy output from a combined cycle power plant.  The goal is to predict the Net hourly electrical energy output of the Power Plant. We use the concept of Artificial Neural Networks to tackle such problems
